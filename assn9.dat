     Write a C function called array_sum() that takes as input
2 arguments, an array of floats and an int that represents
the number of elements in the array.  The function should return
the sum of all the floats in the array.
    Test the program in a driver of your own, and mail me
JUST THE FUNCTION.  I will extract it from mail and test it in
my own driver.  To mail me a file type:

mail -s "C2 assn#N submit" smcgowan your-username < array_sum.c
