# test-project

This is a small c program that I originally wrote somewhere else for a class; I'm mainly uploading it here to test some GitHub features. The original assignment was as follows:
> Write a C function called array_sum() that takes as input 2 arguments, an array of floats and an int that represents the number of elements in the array, and returns the sum of all the floats in the array. Test the program in a driver of your own.
Feel free to ignore this repository; again, I only put this on here to test some features (specifically, releasing builds and how code compilation works online).
